# Follow-up Ideas

1. Surface a chronological conflict log with filters and direct jump-to-time shortcuts.
2. Enable zooming and panning on the SVG canvas for long routes or dense map overlays.
3. Add hover tooltips for stations and crossings that show operational notes and clearance windows.
4. Offer automated spacing suggestions based on selected safety rules or headway targets.
5. Support geographic scaling by reading map projection metadata and syncing kilometer markers.
6. Generate printable / shareable reports that snapshot the timetable, warnings, and map overlays.
