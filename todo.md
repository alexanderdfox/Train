# Follow-up Ideas

1. Add keyboard shortcuts for play/pause, scrub, and zoom to speed up scenario navigation.
2. Support saving named presets for playback speed, viewport, and filters alongside scenario files.
3. Allow grouping trains into service sets with shared colors and tags for easier roster management.
4. Provide an overlay that visualizes predicted headways and safe distances along the track.
5. Integrate export to CSV/XML for sharing timetable and conflict data with external tools.
6. Offer a dark/light theme toggle and improve accessibility contrast ratios and focus states.
7. Implement undo/redo history for key edits such as train adjustments and manual placements.
8. Add analytics to graph train occupancy per block and highlight peak congestion periods.
9. Support custom background layers (e.g., base maps, aerial imagery) with opacity controls.
10. Enable collaboration by allowing scenarios to be shared or merged via cloud storage APIs.
